# ***Coffee Roasting in TensorFlow Model***
This project focuses on building a prediction model, "Coffee Roasting predictive model ". The model uses two features, Temperature in Celsius and Duration in minutes, to predict the probability of achieving a good coffee roast. The project follows the guidelines provided by "Coffee Roasting at Home," aiming for a duration between 12 and 15 minutes and a temperature between 175 and 260 degrees Celsius. The model outputs probabilities, and a threshold of 0.5 is applied to make binary decisions.


I trained a machine learning model in TensorFlow to predict coffee roasting levels based on input features such as temperature and roasting time. The model processes these parameters, learns roasting patterns, and outputs the predicted roast Decison. This helps in automating roasting decisions and ensuring consistency in coffee quality.
